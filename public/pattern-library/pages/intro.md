## Welcome to The Cookbook!
Over the course of a full redesign and adoption of the Jekyll framework, we've worked to distill most of the Campus Dining interface into a set of atomic pieces, forming the Cal Poly Campus Dining Styleguide. It's an internal guide & code repository for designing and coding at Campus Dining. The beauty and simplicity of this styleguide is that it's baked right into our Jekyll framework. Changes to our Sass is tied to our website and the styleguide. Automation and simplicity is king in the world of web - and makes developers smile. [Watch this lecture](https://vimeo.com/109130093) on Atomic Design by Brad Frost to learn more.

The styleguide helps our internal team in the following ways:
1. We can build consistently, focusing our energy on workflows and logic, not hero blocks and form elements.
2. We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel. If a new component is required, we can add it here for future use.
3. We can see all of our styles and patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.
4. Our styleguide is both a learning tool and a compass to correct our course as we build new things.
