# Cal Poly Corporation Jekyll Boilerplate
=============

This is a lightweight boilerplate of [Cal Poly Dining's site](https://www.calpolydining.com/) including error pages and pattern library. The pattern library was created with [Astrum](https://github.com/NoDivide/astrum). The site is build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) as the task runner.  

## Get Started
1.  Install [Node.js](www.nodejs.org) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
2.  Run `gem install bundler`
3.  Install 'grunt-cli' and 'bower' globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
4.  `$cd` to the directory and run `bundle install`
5.  Run `npm install` to install the necessary "npm" dependencies
6.  Then run `bower install` to install the front-end dependencies
7.  **That's all. Your Cal Poly Corporation Jekyll Boilerplate website is ready**
> Built using the [Optimized Jekyll Site With Grunt project](https://github.com/ozasadnyy/optimized-jekyll-grunt) by [Oleh Zasadnyy](https://github.com/ozasadnyy)
> You can find more information about the project in [this article](http://o.zasadnyy.com/blog/optimized-jekyll-site-with-grunt).


## Astrum 

Astrum was used for the pattern library meant to update the current pattern library. This updated library includes added documentation for new components. 

## Changelog is auto generated [with this repo](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator#installation.) 

1. Install the ruby gem that holds this changelog generator.
```
CPC-MC$ [sudo] gem install github_changelog_generator
```
2. If you currently have a changelog and want it to be appended to the autogenerated log, change the name of that changelog to HISTORY.md. 

3. For private repositories, you must gain access of a Github API key to be able to use the changelog generator. This can be done [through here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

To use the generator, use this. If the repository is not private, omit the --token tag and value. 

```
CPC-MC$ github_changelog_generator github_username/github_project --token "api_key"
```
For example, 

```
CPC-MC$ github_changelog_generator cpc-it/cd-jekyll-grunt-boilerplate --token "125f644db4b4f59acf7d5fceadb0714e1bbc11b1"
```
