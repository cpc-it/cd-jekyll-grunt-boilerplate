	<h1>Goodbye Bishops!</h1>
	<p>At the end of the 2015-16 academic year, Cal Poly Corporationâ€™s master plan for Campus Dining will get underway with the closure of Vista Grande and development of a new state-of-the-art dining complex to replace the existing 43-year-old facility. Conceived to address the growing needs of the campus for on-trend dining options, this complex was planned based on research and analysis of the latest culinary concepts and campus community input. The new three-story dining complex will feature six micro-restaurants with exhibition-style cooking along with increased seating and lounge space.  All of this will be encompassed in a modern building that boasts LEED certification for sustainable, resource-efficient design. With an expected completion time of just over two years and a cost of approximately $30 million, Campus Dining plans to open the new Vista Grande Dining Complex in fall of 2018.</p>
